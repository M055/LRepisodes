# LRepisodes
This project is a fan-project to support the Limited Resources podcast (lrcast.com). It scrapes the web pages across the podcast website and youtube channel to recover episode-wise information, and collate it into an easily searchable/sortable online spreadsheet:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k29MiYCIhypR9hsDBWBe5aGOIh1mEx01CR_K2feNEpk/edit?usp=sharing 

Key code (Python 3, JupyterLab Notebooks) and documents used for generating the data are collected here for the community.
NB: the code will not necessarily work out of the box â€“ in particular you will need your own Google API credentials.
