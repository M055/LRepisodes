This week on Limited Resources Brian and Marshall take some time to discuss a variety of topics including the big MTGO changes, UW Heroic, Signals in Theros, and revisit the last episode.
**SIGNOFF SPOILER**
Today’s signoff was based on real life events.  My MTGO opponent played a turn 5 Shipbreaker Kraken (With Karametra Acolyte), and hit me with the premature “GG”– my number one online pet peeve.  You’re not going to tilt me, what you will do is make sure that I give my %110 to make you regret it.  Next turn he sends his Kraken into my team, and attempts to monstrify, but he only has 7 mana.  I get to stack up some blockers, which he foils with a bounce spell.  During his end step, I kill the Kraken with a Lightning Strike.  I go on to win the game, but before he takes his last draw step, I pause.  I wait for a few seconds.  Then I say, “GG”.  To bring the justice level up a whole other level, he was probably playing two tournaments at once (my other pet peeve), and lost the match due to time in game 3.

This week on Limited Resources Marshall and Luis dive ever further into the world of Magic Origins Limited. After getting a GP and a bunch of drafts under their belts, the guys break down what strategies are working and which aren’t. 
Luis’s Cooking Level Up Info:
Brine – 1/2 cup salt per 2 quarts water plus 2 bay leaves – use this before roasting anything (chicken, beef, pork) and it will be much better.
Brine for 12-24 hours in a ziploc bag, then pat dry before applying dry rub
Dry rub base:
1 tbsp garlic powder
1 tbsp paprika
1 tbsp chipotle powder
1 tbsp cayenne pepper
1 tbsp chili powder
1 tbsp salt
1 tbsp ground pepper
 
For pork:
Pork shoulder
1/2 cup brown sugar
roast at 225 for 1.5 hours per pound

This week on Limited Resources Marshall and Luis talk about mana curves and how they differ between archetypes. They also preview three exclusive cards from Eternal Masters, and they are sweeet. 
Aggro deck suggested curve:
1-Drops: 0-3? [If good ones in format, etc.] – Don’t make the common mistake of adding bad 1’s. We are talking Thraben Inspector, not Kitesail Scout.
2-Drops: 6+
3-Drops: 4+
4-Drops: 4-
5-Drops: 2-
6+Drops: 0
Control:

Creatures

1-Drops: 0 (if you find good 1’s, sure, but you don’t need any)
2-Drops: 2-4 (in SOI, fewer. These also need to defend you – 2/1 flying can’t block is NOT a card). Ideally these are useful in the lategame too.
3-Drops: 4-6 (lean towards defense)
4-Drops: 4-5 (still want blockers – but cards that can win games are still good. Solitary Hunter is a fine card)
5-Drops: 2-4 [Here is where you start leaning towards ways to win, since 5’s aren’t the most reliably defense)
6+Drops: 1-3+ [Finishers]

COOKING A MEDIUM RARE STEAK
Let sit until room temperature
Pat dry with paper towel
Rub steak with olive oil, salt, and pepper
Preheat oven to 400 degrees
Heat cast iron pan on high
Sear both sides for a minute (and if thick, the edges as well, for a little less time)
*OPTIONAL* – put pat of butter on each side of the steak
Put in oven until internal temp hits 120-125
Remove, cover with aluminum foil and let sit for 15 minutes
Slice, enjoy, ideally with some roasted veggies

This week on Limited Resources Marshall debuts a very special episode of LR. This episode was entirely post-produced, allowing a much deeper look at a given subject.
Marshall had a chance to talk with Magic Hall of Famers Ben Stark and William “Huey” Jensen about what separates the very best players in the game from the merely great. You’ll get an incredibly in depth view at the moving parts of the elite players of our game.
If you are looking to level up to the very top, you won’t want to miss this one!
Thank you to everyone on the Patreon and Channelfireball for supporting the show and making special projects like this possible!
